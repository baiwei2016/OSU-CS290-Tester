Document Structure
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. When people think of the language used to write web pages, this is usually what comes to mind.

Page Look and Feel
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is the language that is used to actually modify the layout and styling of a page. 

HTTP and TCP/IP
HTTP is more fundamental to this class. It is more like that language that is spoken on the 'call' between the client and the server.
